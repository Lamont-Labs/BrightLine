Version: v2.0 • Date: 2025-10-05  
Owner: Jesse J. Lamont • Org: Lamont-Labs  
Description: AI compliance trust bridge proving originality over policing.

## Overview
BrightLine™ demonstrates a transparent, privacy-first framework for verifying AI-assisted writing originality.  
It provides educators and institutions a reproducible audit chain instead of opaque “detection” systems.

### Key Concepts
- **Proof-over-policing:** verify originality with provenance logs.  
- **Guidance mode:** help students cite responsibly.  
- **Transparency-first:** educators see guidance context, not raw AI output.

### Repo Layout
See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for detailed structure.  
Run the verification script to ensure determinism:
```bash
bash verify.sh
